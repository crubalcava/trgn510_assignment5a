API and Join

"This assignment will be used to join This exercise is to get us used to using APIs and joins.  In this exercise we explore whether there is obvious evidence for a correlation b/t number of hospital beds and COVID mortality. Intuitively, one might think that more hospital beds improve mortality within a region. Here, we want to complete a very quick cursory view of this premise." 

### For this exercise we will start by using 2 COVID dataset API. 

### First Data Set API
* The API Docs are here: https://covid-19-apis.postman.com/) and  API manual: https://api.covid19api.com/countries. Call API https://api.covid19api.com/live/country/united-states.

### Second Data Set API
* Call API: https://www.communitybenefitinsight.org/api/get_hospitals.php and API Documents: https://www.communitybenefitinsight.org/?page=info.data_api

#### Join these two API
We find that buying more hospital beds does not improve the covid mortality rate. 

There is steps and explanation embedded.
